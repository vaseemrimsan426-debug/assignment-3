            <h4>Survilance Robo Car</h4>
            <p>We bulid a small surveillance robot car using Arduino serves as a cost-effective, mobile, and remotely operated security device, typically built on a 2WD chassis driven by geared DC motors controlled by an Arduino Uno. The brain of the robot, the Arduino, receives directional commands—forward, backward, left, or right—via wireless modules like ESP8266/ESP32 Wi-Fi from an Android application or web browser. To facilitate surveillance, a wireless IP camera is mounted on top, providing real-time video feed to the operator's smartphone or PC, often with a servo motor allowing the camera to pan and tilt. The motors are interfaced through an L298N motor driver module, allowing the Arduino to control their speed and direction.</p>

            <h4>Automatic Room Light Controller</h4>
            <p>We build a automatic room light controller operates by using sensors to detect the presence or movement of people within a room, sending this data to a microcontroller (such as an Arduino) which controls a relay to automatically switch the lights on or off. When a person enters, sensors—typically Passive Infrared (PIR) for motion or ultrasonic for distance—detect the presence, signaling the microcontroller to activate the relay, which closes the circuit and powers the lights. The system continuously monitors for activity; if no motion is detected for a predetermined period, or if sensors at the exit detect a person leaving, the microcontroller cuts the signal to the relay, turning the lights off. This system effectively reduces energy consumption by ensuring lights are not left on unnecessarily, offering a sustainable, automated, and convenient solution for residential or commercial lighting management</p>
